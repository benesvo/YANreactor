# YANreactor
yeast assimillable nitrogen demand assay device

Open source Arduino-based bioreactor for assay of yeast assimillable nitrogen (YAN) demand of yeast.  
Fermentation vessel (a 1l reagen bottle closed with airlock) is placed with a magnetic stirrer on a load cell-based scale.
Progress of fermentation is monitored as weight (CO2) loss. Once the maximum fermentation speed is reached, it is maintained by automated addition of YAN into the culture. The amount/rate of YAN addition needed to keep the fermentation speed indicates the yeast's YAN demands.
